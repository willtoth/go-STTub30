# go-STTub30
Go interface to STTubeDevice driver which implements driver for ST devices. This can be used instead of libusb to talk to devices using STTub30.sys driver since Windows 10 installs it by default, and the driver should not interfere with other driver packages (different devices) which implement this driver.
